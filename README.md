# [Stan_MD] - [Develop]

## Getting Started

This template by Start Bootstrap was created by and is maintained by **David Miller**, Managing Parter at [Iron Summit Media Strategies](http://www.ironsummitmedia.com/).

Under their terms one can choose one of the following options to get started:
* Download the latest release on Start Bootstrap
* Fork the repository on GitHub


## Md's Version

I first used the first option of downloading and editted it to suite my needs for a web profile.

Later, after joining [Andela](http://www.andela.com) and understanding the importance of VC (Version Control) I forked the repo and editted it to suit me.

Continuous improvements will be made here, then to **staging** branch finally to **master** branch. The gh-pages will maintain the original I forked.


## MD?

Yap. MD is Stan_MD in short. Get to know more about him at his [web profile](http://www.techkenyans.org/jamii/stanmd) hosted by techKenyans.
