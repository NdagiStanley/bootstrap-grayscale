# [Stan_MD] - [Master]

## Getting Started

This template by Start Bootstrap was created by and is maintained by **David Miller**, Managing Parter at [Iron Summit Media Strategies](http://www.ironsummitmedia.com/).

Under their terms one can choose one of the following options to get started:
* Download the latest release on Start Bootstrap
* Fork the repository on GitHub


## MD's Version

I first used the first option of downloading and edited it to suite my needs for a web profile.

Later, after joining [Andela](http://www.andela.com) and understanding the importance of VC (Version Control) I forked the repo and edited it to suit me.

Continuous improvements will be made on the **develop**, then to this branch: **master**. There's no necessity for a **staging** branch in my view :smile:.  The **original** branch will maintain the original state of the repo at the time I forked it.

I have opted to have my GitHub user page. It is now hosted [http://ndagistanley.github.io/]( http://ndagistanley.github.io/) based on the master branch of this repository.


#### MD?

Yap. MD is Stan_MD in short. Get to know more about him at his [web profile](http://www.techkenyans.org/jamii/stanmd) carbon-copy of my GitHub user page (mentioned earlier :point-up: ) hosted by techKenyans.


## DIY

I have a classroom going on! The first assignment for leveling up in using GitHub will have you create a GitHub user page. **D**o **I**t **Y**ourself.
